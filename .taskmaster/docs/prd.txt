# Product Requirements Document: PlayFriends

## 1. Application Overview
PlayFriends is an application that helps users plan activities with their friends. Users can create and join groups, set their food and play preferences, and receive optimized schedule recommendations from the backend based on the group's collective preferences.

## 2. Core Features

### 2.1. User Authentication
- **Sign-up:** Users can create a new account with a unique ID, username, and password.
- **Login:** Registered users can log in using their ID and password to receive an access token.
- **Logout:** Logged-in users can log out.
- **Token Management:** The access token must be stored securely on the client and included in the header of all authenticated API requests.

### 2.2. Group Management
- **Create Group:** Users can create a new group by providing a group name, start time, and end time. The creator automatically becomes the group owner.
- **View All Groups:** Users can browse a list of all active groups to join.
- **View Group Details:** Users can view the details of a specific group, including its members and confirmed schedule.
- **Update Group:** The group owner can modify the group's information.

- **Update Profile:** Users can update their username.

### 2.4. Schedule Recommendation and Confirmation
- **Recommend Categories:** The group owner can request a list of recommended activity categories based on the combined preferences of all group members.
- **Generate Schedule Suggestions:** Based on selected categories, the group owner can generate multiple concrete schedule proposals, each containing specific times, places, and activities.
