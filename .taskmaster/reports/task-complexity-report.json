		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Authentication System",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the authentication system implementation into specific subtasks covering backend API development, frontend component creation, security measures, and testing. Include specific deliverables for each subtask.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves both frontend and backend work with security implications. It requires API endpoints, form validation, token management, middleware implementation, and secure storage considerations. The complexity comes from the security requirements and the need for thorough testing across multiple components."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement User Profile Management",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the user profile management implementation into subtasks covering basic profile information, food preference settings, activity preference settings, API integration, and testing. Include specific UI components and data structures for each subtask.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves creating forms for profile information and complex preference settings. It requires multiple API endpoints and careful consideration of data structures that will later be used by the recommendation engine. The preference UI could be complex with multiple options and settings."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Group Creation and Management",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the group management functionality into subtasks covering group creation, listing, detailed view, editing, deletion, joining/leaving, and permission management. For each subtask, specify the required components, API endpoints, and testing approach.",
			"reasoning": "This task has high complexity due to the number of operations (CRUD plus join/leave), permission handling between owners and members, and the need for multiple views and forms. It involves many API endpoints and UI components with different permission requirements and validation rules."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Build Main Screen and Group Discovery",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the main screen implementation into subtasks covering dashboard layout, group listing functionality, search and filter implementation, quick actions (join/create), and responsive design. For each subtask, specify the components, API integration points, and testing requirements.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves creating the main application interface with search, filtering, and discovery features. While it has several components, the complexity is moderate as it primarily focuses on displaying and filtering data rather than complex business logic. The search and filter functionality adds some complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Group Details Screen",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the group details screen implementation into subtasks covering group information display, member management, role-based controls (owner vs. member), and schedule display. For each subtask, specify the required components and conditional rendering logic.",
			"reasoning": "This task is moderately complex, focusing on displaying detailed information about a group with role-based UI rendering. The conditional display of controls based on user role adds some complexity, but the task is primarily about presenting information rather than complex interactions."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Design Preference-Based Recommendation Engine",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the recommendation engine implementation into subtasks covering preference data modeling, preference aggregation algorithm, category matching logic, scoring system, diversity rules, API endpoint implementation, algorithm optimization, and comprehensive testing. For each subtask, specify the algorithms, data structures, and evaluation metrics.",
			"reasoning": "This is one of the most complex tasks as it involves sophisticated algorithms for preference aggregation, matching, scoring, and ensuring diversity. It requires careful data modeling, mathematical approaches to preference normalization and weighting, and extensive testing with various scenarios to ensure quality recommendations."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Schedule Generation System",
			"complexityScore": 10,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the schedule generation system into subtasks covering time slot allocation, activity duration modeling, location suggestion algorithm, schedule variation generation, schedule scoring, optimization for performance, API implementation, and comprehensive testing. For each subtask, detail the algorithms, constraints, and evaluation criteria.",
			"reasoning": "This is the most complex task in the project, involving advanced algorithms for time allocation, activity planning, location selection, and schedule optimization. It requires solving a complex constraint satisfaction problem with multiple variables and generating diverse yet high-quality schedule options. Performance optimization will be crucial for larger groups."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Schedule Recommendation UI",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the schedule recommendation UI implementation into subtasks covering category recommendation display, category selection mechanism, schedule generation interface, schedule comparison view, timeline visualization, and confirmation flow. For each subtask, specify the required components, interactions, and visual representations.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves creating complex UI components for displaying and interacting with recommendations and schedules. The timeline visualization and schedule comparison features add significant complexity, requiring thoughtful UI design and interaction patterns. The task also needs to handle owner-only permissions and API integration."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Schedule Confirmation and Display",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the schedule confirmation system into subtasks covering schedule selection interface, confirmation API integration, notification system, and schedule display for members. For each subtask, specify the components, data flow, and role-based access controls.",
			"reasoning": "This task is moderately complex, focusing on the final steps of the schedule workflow. It involves selecting and confirming a schedule, notifying members, and displaying the final schedule. The complexity comes from the notification system and role-based display rather than complex algorithms."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Finalize Application Integration and Testing",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the application finalization into subtasks covering navigation implementation, global UI components (header/footer), error handling and loading states, performance optimization, comprehensive testing, deployment preparation, and final polish. For each subtask, specify the integration points, testing strategies, and acceptance criteria.",
			"reasoning": "This task is highly complex due to its integrative nature, requiring work across all application components. It involves ensuring consistent navigation, error handling, loading states, and overall user experience. The comprehensive testing across multiple features and deployment preparation add significant complexity."
